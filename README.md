This a Single Page Web Application (SPA) for the REST-based Retrieval of Shipment-related 
data ( Intermodal Transports/Costs, Ocean Routing).

The SPA is based on the Angular CLI/Angular 5 platfrom, using Angular Material and Material Design Light as 
additional frameworks/technologies.

For UI user input and their processing Angular Reactive Forms are used. REST calls via HttpClient are capsulated by
 Services and processed asynchroneous via Observables.
 
 The SPA is further separated by Modules with one Root module as the main entry point and three sub modules that encapsulate
 distinct business processes.
 
Automated tests for Modules, Components and Services refelct another important aspect (and are based on Karma and Jasmine).
